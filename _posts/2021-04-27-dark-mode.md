# Code highlight
Mode specific code highlighting themes.

```python

"""
Test file for Python syntax highlighting in editors / IDEs.
Meant to cover a wide range of different types of statements and expressions.
Not necessarily sensical or comprehensive (assume that if one exception is
highlighted that all are, for instance).
Extraneous trailing whitespace can't be tested because of svn pre-commit hook
checks for such things.
